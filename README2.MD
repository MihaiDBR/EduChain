# EduChain

EduChain is our team’s winning project from SmartHack 2025, awarded **1st place** in the “Education in the Era of Technology” theme.  
We designed a decentralised educational platform where teachers create tasks, students stake tokens to attempt them, and earn rewards when they succeed—all underpinned by transparent Web3 mechanics and AI-powered recommendations.
It was built collaboratively by [@MihaiDBR](https://github.com/MihaiDBR) and teammates [@in-th3-l00p](https://github.com/in-th3-l00p), [@rarespapacioc12](https://github.com/rarespapacioc12), [@T0mike](https://github.com/T0mike), and [@laurentiumatica](https://github.com/laurentiumatica) .
